# JUMP-POINT SEARCH
#  Described: https://harablog.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/jump-point-search/
#
# Self-contained version of the jump-point search (jps).
# I chose to use nested functions so that the jps method was self contained, and
# because I wanted to avoid using global variables, which I would have needed because
# I'm calling functions in an order defined by a priority queue.
#
# Using this function: 
#   - use generate_field(...) to create an 2d array denoting which cells are walkable
#   - use jps(...) to get paths.
#   - use get_full_path(...) on the result from jps to get every cell in the path. 
#
# Note: this implementation allows diagonal movement and "corner cutting"
